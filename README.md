# Local field potential project

***Contributers: Sid Rafilson, Nate Hess, Morgan Brown, Matt Smear***

This repository contains code written in both MATLAB and python for analysis of local field potenital (LFP) and thermistory sniff recordings in freely behaving mice. Functions include reading in binary files containing electrophysiology and thermistor sniff recordings, preprocessing data, aligning LFP with inhalation time, plotting, etc.
